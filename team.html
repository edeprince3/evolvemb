The <a href=https://scidac5-fastmath.lbl.gov/home>SciDAC-5 FASTMath
Institute</a> has partnered with researchers from Florida State
University, the University of Washington, and Virgina Tech to bring
together experts in quantum many-body approches, relativistic theory, and
high-performance computing in order to tackle one of the grand outstanding
challenges in computational chemistry: the accurate and efficient <i>ab
initio</i> description of correlated many-electron dynamics and
spin-dependent processes.
