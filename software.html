<a href=https://urania.chem.washington.edu/chronusq/chronusq_public/-/wikis/home>Chronus Quantum</a> 
is an <i>ab initio</i> computational chemistry software package 
that focuses on explicitly time-dependent and unconventional post-SCF 
quantum mechanical methods. <br>

<br>

Through this SciDAC partnership, we are developing time-dependent and relativistic 
formulations of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster and 
multireference configuration interaction methods in Chronus Quantum,
and we are designing our codes such that they can be deployed in massively-parallel computing environments.
To this end, our codes rely on the scalable tensor framework <a href=https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray>TiledArray</a>. <br>
