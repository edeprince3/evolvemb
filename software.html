<a href=https://urania.chem.washington.edu/chronusq/chronusq_public/-/wikis/home>Chronus Quantum</a> 
is an <i>ab initio</i> computational chemistry software package 
that focuses on explicitly time-dependent and unconventional post-SCF 
quantum mechanical methods. <br>

<br>

Through this SciDAC partnership, we are developing predictive relativistic correlated 
electronic structure methods built upon the full Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. Our current 
targets are time-dependent and relativistic 
formulations of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster and multireference configuration interaction methods,
and we are designing our codes such that they can be deployed in massively-parallel computing environments.
To this end, our codes rely heavily on the tensor algebra framework <a href=https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray>TiledArray</a>.
