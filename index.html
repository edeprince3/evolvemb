There is a growing need in the computational chemical sciences for accurate first-principles descriptions of the relativistic quantum dynamics of many-electron systems. This need is driven by emerging quantum technologies that take on an ever-increasing role in material design, as scientists and engineers seek to manipulate spins or generate new states of matter toward a variety of goals, including light harvesting, super conductivity, and quantum information science. Fundamental to these scientific and technological applications are the correlated many-electron dynamics of systems driven far from equilibrium. A grand and outstanding challenge in the field is the accurate and efficient <i>ab initio</i> description of such dynamics, especially when considering spin-dependent processes (<i>e.g.</i>,  spin-coherence, spin-entanglement, intersystem crossing, etc.). <br>

Our team is developing quantum dynamics software that incorporates <i>predictive</i> relativistic correlated electronic structure methods built upon the full Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. Specifically, we are pursuiing time-dependent and relativistic formulations of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster and multireference configuration interaction methods. The steep computational costs of these approaches can be mitigated through advanced wave function compression techniques (<i>e.g.</i>, via machine learning, tensor decompositions, etc.), and all software is being designed for deployment in massively-parallel computing environments such as those at Department of Energy Leadership Computing Facilities. <br>
