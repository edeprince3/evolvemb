There is a growing need in the computational chemical sciences for
accurate first-principles descriptions of the relativistic quantum
dynamics of many-electron systems. This need is driven by emerging quantum
technologies that take on an ever-increasing role in material design, as
scientists and engineers seek to manipulate spins or generate new states
of matter toward a variety of goals, including light harvesting, super
conductivity, and quantum information science.  Fundamental to these
scientific and technological applications are the correlated many-electron
dynamics of systems driven far from equilibrium, the accurate and
efficient description of which represents a grand outstanding challenge in
computational chemistry, especially when considering 
spin-dependent processes (<i>e.g.</i>,  spin-coherence,
spin-entanglement, intersystem crossing, etc.).

The <a href=https://scidac5-fastmath.lbl.gov/home>SciDAC-5 FASTMath
Institute</a> has partnered with researchers from Florida State
University, the University of Washington, and Virgina Tech to bring
together experts in quantum many-body approches, relativistic theory, and
high-performance computing in order to tackle one of the grand outstanding
challenges in computational chemistry: the accurate and efficient <i>ab
initio</i> description of correlated many-electron dynamics and 
spin-dependent processes (<i>e.g.</i>,  spin-coherence,
spin-entanglement, intersystem crossing, etc.).

The EvolveMB team is developing quantum dynamics software that
incorporates <i>predictive</i> relativistic correlated electronic
structure methods built upon the full Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. We
are pursuing time-dependent and relativistic formulations of the
equation-of-motion coupled-cluster and multireference configuration
interaction methods. The steep computational costs of these approaches can
be mitigated through advanced wave function compression techniques
(<i>e.g.</i>, via machine learning, tensor decompositions, etc.), and via
deployment in massively-parallel
computing environments such as those at Department of Energy Leadership
Computing Facilities. <br>
